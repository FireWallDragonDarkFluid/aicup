環境：Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS python 3.9.13
套件安裝：
1) Go to https://pytorch.org/ to install pytorch
2) Go to https://docs.fast.ai/ to see how to install fastai and timm
the two main dependencies list above change their install way quite frequently, 
had better to take a look what they say to install their application
3) install any dependency that can open and edit jupyter file. I use vscode and 
install the ikernel, but anything like it should be fine

The code remained in the repository show how load, fine tune, and ensemble the 
models, to prove these code really worked and written by me
